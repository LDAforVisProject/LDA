Final Report Guidelines (http://vda.cs.univie.ac.at/Teaching/Vis/14s/project.html)
M4: Final Report

Due date: Jun 22, Sunday before the presentations 
Report format: PDF document
The final report should be a stand-alone document describing your complete project. You should assume the reader has no prior knowledge of your project and has not read your proposal. Include the following information in your report:

Motivation
Background information about the problem, tasks, users, and data
Related work
Other visualization solutions to this problem or similar problems
Any previous visualization ideas that you incorporated into your solution
Approach
Description of your visualization design
Reasons for your design choices
Implementation
Brief description of how the system was implemented (toolkits, languages, platforms)
Any serious implementation challenges you encountered and how you handled them
Results
Scenario(s) of use, including screen shots of the system being used
Performance of the system
Feedback from the evaluations about the design and functionality of your tool.
Discussion
Strengths and weaknesses of your approach and implementation
Lessons you learned
References
Your report should include screen shots of your software that demonstrate how it functions. There is no specific page limit so take as much room as you need for images. Some of the above sections will be much longer than others. (I would strongly advocate to write your report using the latex templates used for the Vis conference.)
