Special attention is given to the situations where the sampling domain is a two-dimensional plane, 3-D volume, or a closed 3-D surface. The authors first discuss the multiquadric and thin-plate spline methods for interpolating scalar data sampled at arbitrary locations in a plane. Straightforward generalizations are then made to data sampled in 3-D volumetric regions as well as in higher dimensional spaces. The globally defined interpolants can be evaluated on a fine regular grid and they can then be visualized using conventional techniques. Triangular and tetrahedral based visualization techniques are also presented	Foley, T.A.;Lane, D.A.	Dept. of Comput. Sci., Arizona State Univ., Tempe, AZ, USA|c|;	37393753600;38227316500

The authors describe some of the solutions adopted, specifically in surface discrimination and shading. Nerve cells (neuroblastoma) grown in tissue culture were selected as the biological preparation because these cells possess very rich actin structures. The cells were stained with a fluorescent probe specific for actin (rhodamine-phalloidin) and were viewed and optically sectioned using the Bio-Rad MRC 600 confocal fluorescence microscope. The slice dataset was then reconstructed and processed in the BioCube environment, a comprehensive system developed for volume visualization of cellular structures. The actin cytoskeleton of single cells was visualized and manipulated using this system	Kaufman, A.;Bakalash, R.	Dept. of Comput.

The system supports a variety of visualization methods with applicability in disciplines such as computational fluid dynamics, earth, and space sciences, and finite-element analysis. The authors discuss how design goals and hardware constraints lead to a simple, cohesive paradigm for implementing a powerful, flexible, and portable visualization system. To assure efficient operation across a broad range of hardware platforms, the tools were implemented so that their interactivity is largely independent of data complexity. To gain portability, the system was built on a platform-independent graphics layer and user interface management system. The authors outline general concerns with current visualization methods and show how the approach simplifies the visualization process	Brittain, D.L.;Aller, J.;Wilson, M.;Wang, S.-L.C.

In this new method the spectral curves of surface properties and light composition are represented by spline functions of wavelength. These functions can cover the entire electromagnetic (EM) waves bandwidth, and incorporate the thermal radiation of objects into the surface property description. In particular, a temperature-dependent emission spectral distribution can be assigned to each object for imaging the nonvisible thermal spectra which may become visible due to blue shift. The Doppler shift and shading operations are performed through the manipulation of spline coefficients. The evaluation of the spline functions, which is computationally expensive, is only carried out once-at the end of each shading loop for generating the display RGB values	Hsiung, P.-K.;Thibadeau, R.H.;Cox, C.B.;Dunn, R.H.P.;Wu, M.;Olbrich, P.A.

The authors describe an approach to this problem, based on a classification of visualization techniques, that is independent of particular application domains. A user breaks up a problem into subproblems, describes these subproblems in terms of the objects to be represented and the operations to be supported by a representation, locates applicable visualization techniques in a catalog, and combines these representations into a composite representation for the original problem. The catalog and its underlying classification provide a way for workers in different application disciplines to share methods	Wehrend, S.;Lewis, C.

The authors present an algorithm that produces a hierarchy of triangulations in which each level of the hierarchy corresponds to a guaranteed level of accuracy. The number of very thin triangles (slivers) is significantly reduced. Such triangles produced undesirable effects in animation. In addition the number of levels of the triangulated irregular network (TIN) tree is reduced. This speeds up searching within the data structure. Tests on data with digital elevation input have confirmed the theoretical expectations. On eight such sets the average sliveriness with the method was between 1/5 and 1/10 of old triangulations and number of levels was about one third. There was an increase in the number of descendants at each level, but the total number of triangles was also lower	Scarlatos, L.;Pavlidis, T.

The basic parameters of current TV, the origins of HDTV, and the various types of TV systems being proposed in Japan, America and Europe are reviewed. Available HDTV hardware, new applications that this hardware enables, and the economics involved are discussed. How HDTV fits into the film and television industries from the perspectives of production, distribution, and creativity, HDTV's demands upon telecommunications, and why data compression plays a critical role have been examined. The evolution of the present workstation from many analytical perspectives, leading up to the most recent product introductions of all the major vendors, developments in accelerator boards and interactive graphics peripherals, and the evolution of the man/machine interface are discussed	Herr, L.

The computations are cut down by an order. Simple ways of displaying the fractal without shading and ways of fast ray tracing such a fractal using the table so generated are discussed. Further speedup in ray tracing can be achieved by estimates of a distance of a point from the Mandelbrot set. Animation is a key factor in visualizing 4-D objects. Three types of animation are attempted: translation in 4-D, rotation in 4-D, and fly-through in 3-D	Ke, Y.;Panduranga, E.S.	Dept. of Comput.

The psychophysical considerations for selecting color and brightness level are used to visualize functional and anatomical structures in three dimensions. One is able to perceive in the images the levels of rates of glucose metabolism of regions in the brain and their relative locations. In addition, some of the anatomic structures, such as the interhemispheric fissure, the caudate nucleus, and the thalamus, are apparent	Gershon, N.D.	MITRE Corp., McLean, VA, USA|c|	37352200300

The authors describe a computer system that automatically constructs the shape of a 3-D object from a single 2-D sketch. The method makes it convenient to create and manipulate 3-D objects, and is thus seen as an intelligent user interface for CAD and 3-D graphics applications. The proposed technique is built on well-known results in image analysis. These results are applied in conjunction with some perceptual rules to determine 3-D structure from a rough line drawing. The principles are illustrated by a computer implementation that works in a nontrivial object domain	Lamb, D.;Bandopadhay, A.	Dept. of Comput.

The authors utilized custom software for interactive analysis of a three-dimensional model, plus Wavefront software to render translucent images of the 3D surfaces. The results show that under conditions of no peripheral chemosensor sensitivity, periodic breathing is predicted to occur with (1) an increase in circulatory transit time between the lungs and brain, (2) the presence of marked steady state hypoventilation, and/or (3) an increase in brain blood flow rate. It is concluded that the peripheral chemosensors (carotid bodies) are not essential for the development of periodic breathing	Fordyce, W.E.;Ventrella, J.J.	Res. Comput.

Less than full-resolution sampling of the scalar field is performed using a fast ray tracing method. The sampling grid points are output as a set of screen-based Gouraud shaded polygons which are rendered in hardware by a graphics workstation.

The example used is a 13-parameter set of solar wind, magnetosphere, and ground observation data collected hourly for 21 days in 1976. The software system is a prototype developed to demonstrate the glyph approach to depicting higher-dimensional data sets.

The author addresses the questions of representation and display in a higher dimensional setting, specifically, that of 3-manifolds immersed in four-dimensional space. The author describes techniques for visualizing the cross-section surfaces of a 3-manifold formed by a cutting hyperplane. The manifold is first triangulated, so that the cross-section may be computed on a per tetrahedron basis. The triangulated manifold is stored in a data structure which efficiently supports calculation of curvature. These techniques have been implemented on Personal IRIS	Laszlo, M.J.	Dept. of Electr.

The authors collected hierarchical sorting data from twelve subjects. Five principal groups of visual representations emerged from a cluster analysis of sorting data: graphs and tables, maps, diagrams, networks, and icons. Two dimensions appear to distinguish these clusters: the amount of spatial information and cognitive processing effort.

It provides a widget-based user interface and fast visual response which allows scientists to interactively explore their data sets. VIS-5D generates literal and intuitive depictions of data, has user controls that are data oriented rather than graphics oriented, and provides a WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) response.

The use of chain codes as a boundary representation for 2-D objects undergoing animation is shown to be practical for several typical transformations. Various methods for implementing the transformations are described. Quantized methods transform groups of chain code elements into other groups, while incremental methods construct the transformed chain code element by element. The low cost of quantized methods, which rely on table lookup and minimal arithmetic, are weighed against the increased accuracy offered by incremental methods, which maintain error indicators to ensure minimal differences between ideal and generated chain codes. Methods for scaling, rotation, and elastic deformation of objects based solely on chain code elements are discussed	Maeder, A.J.	Dept. of Comput.

The interface is built on three types of objects: volumes, which contain the data to be visualized, environments, which set up viewing and lighting, and image objects, which convert results to a user-definable format. A volume is rendered against a particular environment with the results sent to an image object for conversion.

Among its applications is the ability to furnish a user with a comprehensive environment for analysis and visualization. With this program the user can produce a document that contains mathematics, datasets and associated visualizations. From the dataset or embedded mathematics animated sequences can be produced in situ. Equations that appear in a document have a backing format that is compatible with the Mathematica language. Thus, by clicking on an equation, its semantics are conveyed to Mathematica, where the user can perform a variety of symbolic and numerical operations. Since the document is all digital, it can be shared on a local network or mailed electronically to a distant site. Animations and any other substructures of the document persist through the mailing process and can be awakened at the destination by the recipient	Phillips, R.L.	Los Alamos Nat.

In either case, supercomputer computation rates are available for the visualization process.

The method is robust up to degree 15, handling singularities without introducing spurious rendering artifacts. The approach does not solve the problem of singularities in general, but it removes the problem from the rendering domain to the interpolation/approximation domain. It is based on finding real roots of a polynomial in Bernstein form. This makes it particularly suitable for parallel and pipelined processing. It is envisioned that the tensor products will be used as approximants or interpolants for empirical data or scalar fields. An interpolation scheme is given as an example	Rockwood, A.

This is accomplished by starting with a simple model that is already topologically closed and deforming the model, based on a set of constraints, so that the model grows (shrinks) to fit the feature within the image while maintaining its closed and locally simple nature. The initial model is a non-self-intersecting polygon that is either embedded in the feature or surrounds the feature. There is a cost function associated with every vertex that quantifies its deformation, the properties of simple polygons, and the relationship between noise and feature. The constraints embody local properties of simple polygons and the nature of the relationship between noise and the features in the image	Miller, J.V.;Breen, D.E.;Wozny, M.J.	Rensselaer Design. Res.

This step uses a quarternion square root function to adapt the classic inverse iteration algorithm to the quaternions. The augmented version produces a 3-D Julia set defined by a point cloud that can be interactively manipulated on a graphics workstation. Several cues are assigned to the point cloud to increase depth perception.

The independent variables do not have to indicate a position in space and can be abstract in the sense that they can represent any quantity. The authors cover only the case where the dependent data is a single scalar. The authors describe a collection of techniques and ideas for graphing cuberille grid data. All of these techniques are quite simple and rather easy to implement. During the development of these techniques, the authors were particularly concerned with allowing the user to interact with the system in order to interrogate and analyze the relationships indicated by the volumetric data	Nielson, G.M.;Hamann, B.

Tangent curves are then integrated out along the principal directions of certain classes of critical points. The points and curves are linked to form a skeleton representing the two-dimensional vector field topology.

Most databases for spherically distributed data are not structured in a manner consistent with their geometry. As a result, such databases possess undesirable artifacts, including the introduction of tears in the data when they are mapped onto a flat file system. Furthermore, it is difficult to make queries about the topological relationship among the data components without performing real arithmetic. The SQT eliminates some of these problems. The SQT allows the representation of data at multiple levels and arbitrary resolution. Efficient search strategies can be implemented for the selection of data to be rendered or analyzed by a specific technique.

The authors give a critical survey of surface interrogation methods. Several isoline and contouring techniques are presented, and the reflection line method, which simulates the so-called light cage by computer graphics, is presented. The isophote method analyzes surfaces by determining lines of equal light intensity. Silhouettes are special isophotes. A different approach to these problems is the mapping-technique. The mapping methods recognize unwanted curvature regions by detecting singularities of a special mapping of the curve or surface investigated. Curvature plots are a practical means of analyzing free-form surfaces. All these methods are effective, but generally need a lot of computational effort.

The proposed approach is applicable to multi-object scenes and to outdoor scenery as well.

Starting with initial concentrations of particles at the boundary-voxels, the diffusion procedure simulates the propagation of these particles inwards. Boundary voxels of the object are colored according to the concentration of particles obtained by suspending the diffusion process.

A system based on the techniques of traditional illustrators for automatically generating illustrations of complex three-dimensional models is described. The system relies on a richer set of display primitives, which are also outlined. Algorithmic details for emphasizing significant model components are discussed, and some preliminary results are presented	Dooley, D.;Cohen, M.F.	Dept. of Comput.

After summarizing the problem at hand, it is concluded that three factors that aided the visualization process in this case can be extracted as general principles: first, focus the viewer on the area of interest; second, do not confuse the viewer with strange color scales; and finally, do not try to convey too much information in one image. Images should convey a maximum amount of information with a minimum of confusion. In this particular case the most useful techniques proved to be animations of color-shaded contours, where the viewer could zoom in on any area of particular interest. Animation was used for each of the seven different data types produced by the analysis package	Edgar, G.W.	Boeing Comput. Services, Seattle, WA, USA|c|	38224911100

The model is more faithful to the structure of computers than the Von Neumann and Turing models. It addresses the issues of data movement and exposes and unifies storage mechanisms such as cache, translation lookaside buffers, main memory, and disks. The visual language presents the details of a computer's memory hierarchy in a concise drawing composed of rectangles and connecting segments. Using this framework, the authors improved the performance of a matrix multiplication algorithm by more than an order of magnitude. The framework gives insight into computer architecture and performance bottlenecks by making effective use of human visual abilities	Alpern, B.;Carter, L.;Selker, T.	IBM Thomas J. Watson Res.

A numerical algorithm to derive spherical reflections is presented. This algorithm has many attractive qualities, such as low computation costs, object space coherence, device and resolution independence, and generation of maximum information about reflections in curved surfaces. The authors demonstrate that rendering reflections is a difficult problem, as it defies analytic solutions.

They present a selection of visualization methods, and describe observations made in the process of creating a three-minute computer animated videotape dealing with some elementary aspects of Fermat's last theorem, a problem in number theory. The approach to the representation of the different concepts presented in the video was influenced by many factors: the available hardware, real and perceived constraints of the available software, constraints imposed by the video medium, and a number of peculiarities and features of the mathematical domain itself.

The acoustic display is capable of generating localized acoustic cues in real time over headphones. An auditor symbology, a related collection of representational auditory objects or icons, can be designed using the auditory cue editor, which links both discrete and continuously varying acoustic parameters with information or events in the display. During a given display scenario, the symbology can be dynamically coordinated in real time with three-dimensional visual objects, speech, and gestural displays. The types of displays feasible with the system range from simple warnings and alarms to the acoustic representation of multidimensional data or events	Wenzel, E.M.;Stone, P.K.;Fisher, S.S.;Foster, S.H.

Bird-oid objects or boids are discussed. These boids derive from: (1) icons which are geometric objects whose shape and appearance are related to the field variables, (2) three-dimensional cursors by which a user interactively picks a point in space, (3) particle traces, which are numerically integrated trajectories in space, (4) moving frames of vectors along space curves, and (5) actors, which are programming objects that can create and destroy instances of themselves, act according to internal logic, and communicate with each other and with a user. A software prototype in the C++ language has been developed which demonstrates some of the capabilities of these objects for the visualization of scalar, vector, and tensor fields defined over finite elements or finite volumes	Kerlick, G.D.

The authors describe the experimental environment used, with particular attention to the hardware and software control environment and the graphical interface. Intelligent system control is achieved through the integration of extensive geometric and kinematic world models with real-time sensor-based control. All operator interactions with the system are through fully animated graphical representations which validate all operator commands before execution to provide for safe operation. Sensing is used to add information to the robot system's world model and to allow sensor-based servo control during selected operations. The results of an initial critical features test are reported, and the potential to apply advanced intelligent control concepts to the removal of waste in storage tanks is discussed	Christensen, B.K.;Desjarlais, L.M.
