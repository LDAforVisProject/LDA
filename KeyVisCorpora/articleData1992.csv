A project undertaken to visualize the simulation results is reported. The project comprised analyzing model requirements and determining suitable visualization techniques, visualizing a preliminary, smaller-scale model to verify the techniques; and visualizing the full-scale model. Problems encountered and resolutions of problems at each stage are described. Validation, as well as insights revealed about the model through the preliminary and final visualization, are discussed.

It is argued that as long as there is a human interface link to computer visualization systems, understanding how humans perceive information visually could help improve the quality and the effectiveness of the visualization process. The fields of visual physiology, psychophysics, and cognitive psychology can explain why human vision is so efficient, how to create better images, and how to determine the limitations of particular representations	Kosslyn, S.M.;Gershon, N.D.;Levkowitz, H.;Pearlman, J.D.

The model has a two layer structure. The lower level is a volume model with a set of semantic attributes belonging to each voxel. Its spatial representation is derived from data sets of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computer tomography. The semantic attributes are assigned by an anatomist using a volume editor. The upper level is a set of relations between these attributes which are also specified by the expert. Interactive visualization tools, such as multiple surface display, transparent rendering, and cutting, are provided. It is shown that the combination of this object-oriented data structure with advanced volume visualization tools provides the look and feel of a real dissection	Hohne, K.H.;Pommert, A.;Riemer, M.;Schiemann, T.;Schubert, R.;Tiede, U.;Lierse, W.	;;;;;;	37378529100;37378525800;37378525600;37372275700;37385792400;37372275900;37378525500

The proposed techniques, probing and stream line display, are related to the measurement techniques used in actual clean rooms. The efficient traverse makes it possible to move freely around a given irregular volume and to spawn off stream lines. A successful application of these techniques to a problem in a clean room is also described	Koyamada, K.	Tokyo Res. Lab., Japan|c|	37284304900

Scientists from several disciplines were observed while they analyzed their own data. Examination of the observations exposed process elements outside conventional image viewing. For example, analysts queried for quantitative information, made a variety of comparisons, applied math, managed data, and kept records. The characterization of scientific data analysis reveals activity beyond that traditionally supported by computer. It offers an understanding which has the potential to be applied to many future designs, and suggests specific recommendations for improving the support of this important aspect of scientific computing	Springmeyer, R.R.;Blattner, M.M.;Max, N.L.

Data Explorer supports the visualization of a wide variety of data by means of a flexible set of visualization modules. A single powerful data model common to all modules allows a wide range of data types to be imported and passed between modules. There is integral support for parallelism, affecting the data model and the execution model. The visualization modules are highly interoperable, due in part to the common data model, and exemplified by the renderer. An execution model facilitates parallelization of modules and incorporates optimizations such as caching. The two-process client-server system structure consists of a user interface that communicates with an executive via a dataflow language	Lucas, B.;Abram, G.D.;Collins, N.S.;Epstein, D.A.;Gresh, D.L.;McAuliffe, K.P.

ISIS is an experimental facility devoted to the use of pulsed neutrons and muons to investigate the microscopic structure and dynamics of all classes of condensed matter. The feasibility study demonstrated the benefits of using visualization in exploring material science data, and also proved that it is possible to satisfy most of the requirements ISIS researchers place on a software environment by using application visualization systems (AVSs), and without writing any new code.

The methods include taking an otherwise static image and displaying in an animation loop either its segmented components or a series of blurred versions of the whole image. This approach was applied to sea-surface temperature data and was found to be effective in showing fuzzy details embedded in the data, and in drawing the viewer's attention. This approach and these methods could play a significant role in the display of browse products for massive data and information systems	Gershon, N.D.	Mitre Corp., McLean, VA, USA|c|	37352200300

Those requirements are illustrated by describing the renderer used in a production scientific visualization system, Data Explorer. The requirements for a visualization renderer are discussed. Implementation techniques used to meet the requirements of parallelism, volume rendering of irregular data, clipping, and integration of rendering modalities are described. The renderer described is a software renderer, but it is hoped that the requirements and implementation presented might influence the design of future generations of rendering hardware	Lucas, B.

The general problem of visualizing unsymmetric real or complex Hermitian second-order tensor fields can be reduced to the simultaneous visualization of a real and symmetric second-order tensor field and a real vector field. The emphasis is on exploiting the mathematical properties of tensor fields in order to facilitate their visualization and to produce a continuous representation of the data. The focus is on interactively sensing and exploring real and symmetric second-order tensor data by generalizing the vector notion of streamline to the tensor concept of hyperstreamline. The importance of a structural analysis of the data field analogous to the techniques of vector field topology extraction in order to obtain a unique and objective representation of second-order tensor fields is stressed	Delmarcelle, T.;Hesselink, Lambertus	Stanford Univ., CA, USA|c|;	37378372200;37274095200

As examples of such graphical displays, two simulation results of using a Kohonen feature map to generate map displays for information retrieval are presented and discussed. The map displays are a mapping from a high-dimensional document space to a two-dimensional space. They show document relationships by various visual cues, such as dots, links, clusters, and areas, as well as their measurement and spatial arrangement. Using the map displays as an interface for document retrieval systems, the user is provided with richer visual information to support browsing and searching	Lin, X.	Center for Comput.

This technique displays the paths of particles under the influence of gravity as described by the general theory of relativity and is useful in the investigation of solutions to the field equations of that theory. A boom-mounted six-degree-of-freedom head-position-sensitive stereo CRT system is used for display. A hand-position-sensitive glove controller is used to control the initial positions and directions of geodesics in spacetime. A multiprocessor graphics workstation is used for computation and rendering. Several techniques for visualizing the geometry of spacetime using geodesics are discussed.

The ability to display arbitrary combinations of an algorithm's data objects in a common frame of reference, coupled with interactive control of algorithm execution, provides a powerful way to understand algorithm behavior. Type definitions are constrained so that all primitive values occurring in data objects are assigned scalar types. A graphical display, including user interaction with the display, is modeled by a special data type.

A graphical technique is used to convert the discretely defined flow within a cell into one represented by two three-dimensional stream functions. Streamlines are calculated by tracking constant values of each stream function, a process which corresponds to finding the intersection of two stream surfaces. The tracking process is mass conservative and does not use a time stepping method for integration, thus eliminating a computationally intensive part of traditional tracking algorithms. The method can be applied generally to any three-dimensional compressible or incompressible steady flow.

Unnecessary triangles are removed. The method is an effective way of guaranteeing that the triangle vertices are points of higher curvature, and that the triangle edges correspond to distinctive edges on the surfaces. Triangulations of surfaces with constant curvature-and hence no distinctive features-will gain nothing from this or any other optimization algorithm. As demonstrated by the results, the techinque of moving triangle vertices can improve some triangulation models. Greatest improvements occur with surfaces characterized by sharp edges, such as the pyramid and ridge models.

DBMS query languages are linear in syntax. Although natural language interfaces have been found to be useful, natural language is ambiguous and difficult to process. For queries on standard (relational) data, these difficulties can be avoided with the use of a visual, graphical interface to guide the user in specifying the query. For image and other media data which are ambiguous in nature, natural language processing, combined with direct graphical access to the domain knowledge, is used to interpret and evaluate the natural language query. The system fully supports graphical and image input/output in different formats. The combination of visual effect and natural language specification, the support of media data, and the allowance of incremental query specification simplify the process of query specification not only for image or multimedia databases but also for all databases	Keim, D.A.;Lum, V.

A visualization testbed, called SuperGlue, which is particularly suited for the rapid development of new visualization methods, was built. An interpreter supports rapid development of new code, and an extensive class hierarchy encourages code reuse. By explicitly designing for ease of programming, it was possible to produce a visualization system which is powerful, easy to use, and rapidly improving. The motivation of the work, the architecture of the system, and plans for further development are reported	Hultquist, J.P.M.;Raible, E.L.	NASA Ames Res.

While designing a quality static 2-D visualization is already a difficult task for most users, designing an interactive 3-D one is even more challenging. To address this problem, AutoVisual, a research system that designs interactive virtual worlds for visualizing and exploring multivariate relations of arbitrary arity, is being developed. AutoVisual uses worlds within worlds, an interactive visualization technique that exploits nested, heterogeneous coordinate systems to map multiple variables onto each spatial dimension. AutoVisual's designs are guided by user-specified visualization tasks, and by a catalog of design principles encoded using a rule-based language	Beshers, C.;Feiner, S.	Dept. of Comput.

This method includes an improved shading model, the use of Gaussian filters for the prevention of spatial and temporal artifacts, an efficient scan-conversion algorithm, the handling of occlusion and the simultaneous rendering of geometric objects and surface-particles.

A hierarchical classification of the components and issues involved is presented, giving an understanding of the design decisions and trade-offs that the developers of these systems are making.

The results of the study, as well as other user experiences with Calico, support the hypothesis that dynamic manipulation of color mappings is a useful feature of systems for the exploration of quantitative data using color. The main effect observed is a clear user preference for representations providing control over the mapping, a small but significant increase in accuracy, and greater confidence in information gleaned from manipulable displays. A smaller and less consistent effect showed greater user preference for an confidence in representations which provided smooth change between images	Rheingans, P.	Dept. of Comput.

The VolVis system is supported by a generalized abstract model which provides for both geometric and volumetric constructs. VolVis contains several rendering algorithms that span the speed versus accuracy continuum. A fast volume rendering algorithm has been developed, which is capable of exploiting existing graphics hardware without placing any viewing restrictions or compromising accuracy. In addition, VolVis includes a volumetric navigation facility, key-frame animation generator, quantitative analysis tools, and a generalized protocol for communicating with 3D input devices	Avila, R.S.;Sobierajski, L.M.;Kaufman, A.E.

Wavelet transform is a signal analysis technique which decomposes a signal using a family of functions having a local property in both time and frequency domains. A multiresolution expression of 3D volume data was first obtained by applying 3D orthogonal wavelet transforms, with the shape then being approximated with a relatively small number of 3D orthogonal functions using only the significant functions. In addition, the resolution of the approximation can be varied point by point using the local property of the wavelets. The method is applied to real volume data, i.e. facial range data and MR images of a human head, and typical results are shown	Muraki, S.	Image Understanding Section, Electrotech.

Interactivity is not restricted to geometric transformations, but includes all possible methods of processing the data. The system flexibly trades-off quality for performance at any desirable level. In particular, by using a scanline based method and a DDA-based traversing scheme instead of ray-tracing one achieves real-time processing during previewing. By means of the `pyramidal volume' traversing technique, one achieves high-quality, constant-time filtering, independent of the data resolution. Several filters help to detect `fuzzy', obscured hot spots, even within noisy data. The visualization pipeline allows the application of filters at four different stages, maximizing their flexibility. Four different illumination models have been implemented	Sakas, G.;Hartig, J.
