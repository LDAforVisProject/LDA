In response, a wide variety of visualization tools have been created to facilitate data analysis. Biologists often face a dilemma in choosing the best tool for their situation. The tool that works best for one biologist may not work well for another due to differences in the type of insight they seek from their data. A primary purpose of a visualization tool is to provide domain-relevant insight into the data. Ideally, any user wants maximum information in the least possible time. In this paper we identify several distinct characteristics of insight that enable us to recognize and quantify it. Based on this, we empirically evaluate five popular microarray visualization tools. Our conclusions can guide biologists in selecting the best tool for their data, and computer scientists in developing and evaluating visualizations	Saraiya, P.;North, C.;Duca, K.	Dept. of Comput.

Subjects performed tasks relating to the structure of a directory hierarchy, and to attributes of files and directories. Task completion times, correctness and user satisfaction were measured, and video recordings of subjects' interaction with the systems were made. Significant system and task type effects and an interaction between system and task type were found. Qualitative analyses of the video recordings were thereupon conducted to determine reasons for the observed differences, resulting in several findings and design recommendations as well as implications for future experiments with tree visualization systems	Kobsa, A.

This evaluation bears on seven generic tasks and leads to important recommendations with regard to the representation of graphs according to their size and density. For instance, we show that when graphs are bigger than twenty vertices, the matrix-based visualization performs better than node-link diagrams on most tasks. Only path finding is consistently in favor of node-link diagrams throughout the evaluation	Ghoniem, M.;Fekete, J.;Castagliola, P.	Ecole des Mines de Nantes|c|;;	37928384500;37407972900;37939616200

The objective of our research has been to develop a method to visualize, and work with, the spatial interconnectedness of information over time and geography within a single, highly interactive 3D view. A novel visualization technique for displaying and tracking events, objects and activities within a combined temporal and geospatial display has been developed. This technique has been implemented as a demonstratable prototype called GeoTime in order to determine potential utility. Initial evaluations have been with military users. However, we believe the concept is applicable to a variety of government and business analysis tasks	Kapler, T.;Wright, W.	;	37704437500;37654961400

Nowadays, different kinds of maps are used to emphasize the spatial distribution of one or more geospatial attributes. The nature of geospatial statistical data is the highly nonuniform distribution in the real world data sets. This has several impacts on the resulting map visualizations. Classical area maps tend to highlight patterns in large areas, which may, however, be of low importance. Cartographers and geographers used cartograms or value-by-area maps to address this problem long before computers were available. Although many automatic techniques have been developed, most of the value-by-area cartograms are generated manually via human interaction. In this paper, we propose a novel visualization technique for geospatial data sets called RecMap. Our technique approximates a rectangular partition of the (rectangular) display area into a number of map regions preserving important geospatial constraints. It is a fully automatic technique with explicit user control over all exploration constraints within the exploration process. Experiments show that our technique produces visualizations of geospatial data sets, which enhance the discovery of global and local correlations, and demonstrate its performance in a variety of applications	Heilmann, R.;Keim, D.A.;Panse, C.;Sips, M.	;;;	37943636700;37283138700;37282557300;37827860500

We start by identifying the relevant data transferred in this kind of networks and the main performance assessment questions. Then we describe the visualization of data from two different points of view. First we take servers as focal points and we introduce a new technique, faded cushioning, which allows visualizing the same data from different perspectives. Secondly, we present the viewpoint of files, and we expose the correlations with the server stance via a special scatter plot. Finally, we discuss how our tool, based on the described techniques, is effective in the performance assessment of peer-to-peer file-sharing networks	Voinea, L.;Telea, A.	Technische Univ.

An important aspect to increase user support and user orientation is to use a history mechanism that, first of all, provides un- and redoing functionality. In this paper, we present a new approach to include such history functionality into a VDM framework. Therefore, we introduce the theoretical background, outline design and implementation aspects of a history management unit, and conclude with a discussion showing the usefulness of our history management in a VDM framework	Kreuseler, M.;Nocke, T.

We propose an extension to the spring model approach that allows the user to interactively explore datasets that are far beyond the scale of previous implementations of MDS. We present MDSteer, a steerable MDS computation engine and visualization tool that progressively computes an MDS layout and handles datasets of over one million points. Our technique employs hierarchical data structures and progressive layouts to allow the user to steer the computation of the algorithm to the interesting areas of the dataset. The algorithm iteratively alternates between a layout stage in which a subselection of points are added to the set of active points affected by the MDS iteration, and a binning stage which increases the depth of the bin hierarchy and organizes the currently unplaced points into separate spatial regions. This binning strategy allows the user to select onscreen regions of the layout to focus the MDS computation into the areas of the dataset that are assigned to the selected bins. We show both real and common synthetic benchmark datasets with dimensionalities ranging from 3 to 300 and cardinalities of over one million points	Williams, M.;Munzner, T.

Two fundamental statistical principles for the exploratory analysis are (1) to examine each dimension first and then find relationships among dimensions, and (2) to try graphical displays first and then find numerical summaries (D.S. Moore, (1999). We implement these principles in a novel conceptual framework called the rank-by-feature framework. In the framework, users can choose a ranking criterion interesting to them and sort 1D or 2D axis-parallel projections according to the criterion. We introduce the rank-by-feature prism that is a color-coded lower-triangular matrix that guides users to desired features. Statistical graphs (histogram, boxplot, and scatterplot) and information visualization techniques (overview, coordination, and dynamic query) are combined to help users effectively traverse 1D and 2D axis-parallel projections, and finally to help them interactively find interesting features	Seo, J.;Shneiderman, B.

In this paper, we propose a new multidimensional visualization technique named a value and relation (VaR) display, together with a rich set of navigation and selection tools, for interactive exploration of datasets with up to hundreds of dimensions. By explicitly conveying the relationships among the dimensions of a high dimensional dataset, the VaR display helps users grasp the associations among dimensions. By using pixel-oriented techniques to present values of the data items in a condensed manner, the VaR display reveals data patterns in the dataset using as little screen space as possible. The navigation and selection tools enable users to interactively reduce clutter, navigate within the dimension space, and examine data value details within context effectively and efficiently. The VaR display scales well to datasets with large numbers of data items by employing sampling and texture mapping. A case study on a real dataset, as well as the VaR displays of multiple real datasets throughout the paper, reveals how our proposed approach helps users interactively explore high dimensional datasets with large numbers of data items	Jing Yang;Anilkumar Patro;Huang Shiping;Nishant Mehta;Ward, M.O.;Rundensteiner, E.A.

In this situation, the strong overlapping of graphical markers severely hampers the user's ability to identify patterns in the data from its visual representation. We tackle this problem here with a strategy that computes frequency or density information from the data set, and uses such information in parallel coordinates visualizations to filter out the information to be presented to the user, thus reducing visual clutter and allowing the analyst to observe relevant patterns in the data. The algorithms to construct such visualizations, and the interaction mechanisms supported, inspired by traditional image processing techniques such as grayscale manipulation and thresholding are also presented. We also illustrate how such algorithms can assist users to effectively identify clusters in very noisy large data sets	Artero, A.O.;Levkowitz, H.	Dept. of Comput.

Clutter can obscure the structure present in the data. Even in a small dataset, clutter can make it hard for the viewer to find patterns, relationships and structure. In this paper, we define visual clutter as any aspect of the visualization that interferes with the viewer's understanding of the data, and present the concept of clutter-based dimension reordering. Dimension order is an attribute that can significantly affect a visualization's expressiveness. By varying the dimension order in a display, it is possible to reduce clutter without reducing information content or modifying the data in any way. Clutter reduction is a display-dependent task. In this paper, we follow a three-step procedure for four different visualization techniques. For each display technique, first, we determine what constitutes clutter in terms of display properties; then we design a metric to measure visual clutter in this display; finally we search for an order that minimizes the clutter in a display	Peng, W.;Ward, M.O.;Rundensteiner, E.A.

A rule-based behavior system continuously controls and updates the dynamic actions of individual, three-dimensional elements that represent the changing data values of reoccurring data objects. As a result, different distinguishable motion types emerge that are driven by local interactions between the spatial elements as well as the evolution of time-varying data values. Notably, this representation technique focuses on the representation of dynamic data alteration characteristics, or how reoccurring data objects change over time, instead of depicting the exact data values themselves. In addition, it demonstrates the potential of motion as a useful information visualization cue. The original information flocking approach is extended to incorporate time-varying datasets, live database querying, continuous data streaming, real-time data similarity evaluation, automatic shape generation and more stable flocking algorithms. Different experiments prove that information flocking is capable of representing short-term events as well as long-term temporal data evolutions of both individual and groups of time-dependent data objects. An historical stock market quote price dataset is used to demonstrate the algorithms and principles of time-varying information flocking	Moere, A.V.

Instead of creating a visualization tool for data analysis, we chose to produce a piece that functions as a souvenir of a particular time and place. We describe the design choices we made in creating this installation, the visualization techniques we developed, and the reactions we observed from users and the media.

However, explicit expansion of nodes can be tedious. Expand-ahead is a space-filling strategy by which some nodes are automatically expanded to fill available screen space, without expanding so far that nodes are shown at a reduced size or outside the viewport. This often allows a user exploring the tree to see further down the tree without the effort required in a traditional browser. It also means the user can sometimes drill-down a path faster, by skipping over levels of the tree that are automatically expanded for them. Expand-ahead differs from many detail-in-context techniques in that there is no scaling or distortion involved. We present 1D and 2D prototype implementations of expand-ahead, and identify various design issues and possible enhancements to our designs. Our prototypes support smooth, animated transitions between different views of a tree. We also present the results of a controlled experiment which show that, under certain conditions, users are able to drill-down faster with expand-ahead than without	McGuffin, M.J.;Davison, G.;Balakrishnan, R.

Similar to a real-world telescope, InfoSky employs a planar graphical representation with variable magnification. Documents of similar content are placed close to each other and displayed as stars, while collections of documents at a particular level in the hierarchy are visualised as bounding polygons. Usability testing of an early prototype implementation of InfoSky revealed several design issues which prevented users from fully exploiting the power of the visual metaphor. Evaluation results have been incorporated into an advanced prototype, and another usability test has been conducted.

Segmentation of the image allow to easily select patches on the image as a way to extract subnetworks. We were inspired by the work of Wattenberg and Fisher [M. Wattenberg et al.

Too often, successful decision-making and analysis are more a matter of serendipity and user experience than of intentional design and specific support for such tasks; although humans have considerable abilities in analyzing relationships from data, the utility of visualizations remains relatively variable across users, data sets, and domains. In this paper, we discuss the notion of analytic gaps, which represent obstacles faced by visualizations in facilitating higher-level analytic tasks, such as decision-making and learning. We discuss support for bridging the analytic gap, propose a framework for design and evaluation of information visualization systems, and demonstrate its use"	Amar, R.;Stasko, J.

Our taxonomy classifies visualization algorithms rather than data. Algorithms are categorized based on the assumptions they make about the data being visualized; we call this set of assumptions the design model. Because our taxonomy is based on design models, it is more flexible than existing taxonomies and considers the user's conceptual model, emphasizing the human aspect of visualization. Design models are classified according to whether they are discrete or continuous and by how much the algorithm designer chooses display attributes such as spatialization, timing, colour, and transparency. This novel approach provides an alternative view of the visualization field that helps explain how traditional divisions (e.g., information and scientific visualization) relates and overlap, and that may inspire research ideas in hybrid visualization areas	Tory, M.;Moller, T.

By coupling visual abstraction with coordination, users gain precise control over how navigation and selection in the visualization affects the appearance of data in individual views. As a result, it is practical to build visualizations with more views and richer coordination in Improvise than in other visualization systems.

The InfoVis toolkit provides specific data structures to achieve a fast action/feedback loop required by dynamic queries. It comes with a large set of components such as range sliders and tailored control panels required to control and configure the visualizations. These components are integrated into a coherent framework that simplifies the management of rich data structures and the design and extension of visualizations. Supported data structures currently include tables, trees and graphs. Supported visualizations include scatter plots, time series, parallel coordinates, treemaps, icicle trees, node-link diagrams for trees and graphs and adjacency matrices for graphs. All visualizations can use fisheye lenses and dynamic labeling. The InfoVis toolkit supports hardware acceleration when available through Agile2D, an implementation of the Java graphics API based on OpenGL, achieving speedups of 10 to 200 times. The article also shows how new visualizations can be added and extended to become components, enriching visualizations as well as general applications	Fekete, J.

For graphs of up to hundreds of nodes and edges, there are many effective techniques available. At greater scale, data density and occlusion problems often negate its effectiveness. Conventional pan-and-zoom, and multiscale and geometric fisheye views are not fully satisfactory solutions to this problem. As an alternative, we describe a topological zooming method. It is based on the precomputation of a hierarchy of coarsened graphs, which are combined on the fly into renderings with the level of detail dependent on the distance from one or more foci.

Visual and computational identification of these ""clusters"" becomes useful when domain experts desire to determine those factors of major influence in the formation of access and communication clusters or in the detection and contention of disease spread. With the current increases in graphic hardware capabilities and RAM sizes, it is more useful to relate graph sizes to the available screen real estate S and the amount of available RAM M, instead of the number of edges or nodes in the graph. We offer a visual interface that is parameterized by M and S and is particularly suited for navigation tasks that require the identification of subgraphs whose edge density is above certain threshold. This is achieved by providing a zoomable matrix view of the underlying data. This view is strongly coupled to a hierarchical view of the essential information elements present in the data domain.

In this paper we present a method to create scalable, interactive visualizations of small world graphs, allowing the user to inspect local clusters while maintaining a global overview of the entire structure. The visualization method uses a combination of both semantical and geometrical distortions, while the layout is generated by a spring embedder algorithm using recently developed force model.

Although no lens offset mode was significantly better than another, most participants preferred the adjacent mode for the locate and compare tasks, and the docked mode for the follow tasks.

IRVDX employs three kinds of visualizations: one provides a reduced representation of the data sets, which we call Dataset Icons. These icons show the important statistical characteristics of data sets and help to identify relevant data sets from distributed repositories. Another one is called the Remote Dataset Visual Browser that provides visualizations to browse remote data without downloading the complete data set to identify its content. The final one provides visualizations to show the degree of similarity between two data sets and to visually determine whether a join of two remote data sets will be meaningful.

One problem often encountered in the process is occlusion: the ambiguity that occurs when records from different data sets are mapped to the same display location. For example, because of occlusion summarizing 1000 graphs by simply stacking them one over another is pointless. We solve this problem by adapting the solution to a similar problem in the Information Murals system [2]: mapping the number of data elements at a location to display luminance. Inspired by histograms, which map data frequency to space, we call our solution histographs. By treating a histograph as a digital image, we can blur and highlight edges to emphasize data features. We also support interactive clustering of the data with data zooming and shape-based selection. We are currently investigating alternative occlusion blending schemes.	Pin Ren;Watson, B.

The Rank-Spiral enables users to rapidly scan large numbers of documents and their titles in a single screen. It uses a spiral mapping that maximizes information density and minimizes occlusions. It solves the labeling problem by exploiting the structure of the special spiral mapping used. Focus+Context interactions enable users to examine document clusters or groupings in more detail.

Lookmarks are pointers to views of specific parts of a dataset. They were so named because lookmarks are to a visualization tool and dataset as bookmarks are to a browser and the World Wide Web. A lookmark can be saved and organized among other lookmarks within the context of ParaView. Then at a later time, either in the same ParaView session or in a different one, it can be regenerated, displaying the exact view of the data that had previously been saved. This allows the user to pick up where they left off, to continue to adjust the view or otherwise manipulate the data. Lookmarks facilitate collaboration between users who wish to share views of a dataset. They enable more effective data comparison because they can be applied to other datasets. They also serve as a way of organizing a users data. Ultimately, a lookmark is a time-saving tool that automates the recreation of a complex view of the data.	Stanton, E.T.;Kegelmeyer, W.P.

Two problems with this approach are (1) dots do not represent data well, (2) reducing to just three dimensions does not make full use of several dimensionality-reduction algorithms. We demonstrate how Partiview can be used to solve these problems, in the context of handwriting recognition and image retrieval.	Surendran, D.;Levy, S.

The human visual system is the result of evolution by natural selection and hence its design must incorporate detailed knowledge of the physical properties of the natural environment. This is an obvious statement, but the scientific community has been slow to take it seriously. Only recently has there been an increased effort to directly measure the statistical properties of natural scenes and compare them to the design and performance of the human visual system. This work describes some recent studies of the chromatic and geometrical properties of natural materials and natural images, as well as some perceptual and physiological studies designed to test how those physical properties are related to human perceptual mechanisms.

Such images brilliantly combine experimental design, analysis, and visualization. Quoting J. Tukey, ""the general purposes of conducting experiments and analyzing data match, point by point"".

It occurs whenever images or volumes are magnified, rotated, translated, or warped. Resampling is also an integral procedure in the registration of multimodal datasets, such as CT, PET, and MRI, in the correction of motion artifacts in MRI, and in the alignment of temporal volume sequences in fMRI. It is well known that the quality of the resampling result depends heavily on the quality of the interpolation filter used. However, high-quality filters are rarely employed in practice due to their large spatial extents. We explore a new resampling technique that operates in the frequency-domain where high-quality filtering is feasible. Further, unlike previous methods of this kind, our technique is not limited to integer-ratio scaling factors, but can resample image and volume datasets at any rate. This would usually require the application of slow discrete Fourier transforms (DFT) to return the data to the spatial domain. We studied two methods that successfully avoid these delays: the chirp-z transform and the FFTW package. We also outline techniques to avoid the ringing artifacts that may occur with frequency-domain filtering. Thus, our method can achieve high-quality interpolation at speeds that are usually associated with spatial filters of far lower quality.	Li, A.;Mueller, K.;Ernst, T.	Comput. Sci.

The quality of these filters, when used in reconstructing BCC sampled volumetric data, is discussed and is demonstrated with a raycaster. Moreover, to demonstrate the superiority of the BCC sampling, the resulting reconstructions are compared with those produced from similar filters applied to data sampled on the Cartesian lattice.

Our technique exploits the ray coherence during ray casting by using the distance a ray traverses in empty space to leap its neighboring rays. Our technique works with parallel as well as perspective volume rendering, does not require any preprocessing or 3D data structures, and is independent of the transfer function. Being an image-space technique, it is independent of the complexity of the data being rendered. It can be used to accelerate both time-coherent and noncoherent animation sequences.

Unfortunately, even implementations of the most advanced variants of the PT algorithm are very prone to rendering artifacts. In this work, we identify linear interpolation in screen coordinates as a cause for significant rendering artifacts and implement the correct perspective interpolation for the PT algorithm with programmable graphics hardware. We also demonstrate how to use features of modern graphics hardware to improve the accuracy of the coloring of individual tetrahedra and the compositing of the resulting colors, in particular, by employing a logarithmic scale for the preintegrated color lookup table, using textures with high color resolution, rendering to floating-point color buffers, and alpha dithering. Combined with a correct visibility ordering, these techniques result in the first implementation of the PT algorithm without objectionable rendering artifacts. Apart from the important improvement in rendering quality, our approach also provides a test bed for different implementations of the PT algorithm that allows us to study the particular rendering artifacts introduced by these variants.

We define a local alignment tensor that encodes a measure for alignment to the direction of a given flow field. This tensor induces an anisotropic differential operator on the flow domain, which is discretized with a standard finite element technique. The entries of the corresponding stiffness matrix represent the anisotropically weighted couplings of adjacent nodes of the domain mesh. We use an algebraic multigrid algorithm to generate a hierarchy of fine to coarse descriptions for the above coupling data. This hierarchy comprises a set of coarse grid nodes, a multiscale of basis functions and their corresponding supports. We use these supports to obtain a multilevel decomposition of the flow structure. Standard streamline icons are used to visualize this decomposition at any user-selected level of detail. The method provides a single framework for vector field decomposition independent on the domain dimension or mesh type.

A CVT is a special Voronoi tessellation for which the generators of the Voronoi regions in the tessellation are also the centers of mass (or means) with respect to a prescribed density. A distance function in both the spatial and vector spaces is introduced to measure the similarity of the spatially distributed vector fields. Based on such a distance, vector fields are naturally clustered and their simplified representations are obtained. Our method combines simple geometric intuitions with the rigorously established optimality properties of the CVTs. It is simple to describe, easy to understand and implement. Numerical examples are also provided to illustrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of the CVT-based vector simplification and visualization methodology.

EWA splatting combines a Gaussian reconstruction kernel with a low-pass image filter for high image quality without aliasing artifacts or excessive blurring. We introduce a novel adaptive filtering scheme to reduce the computational cost of EWA splatting. We show how this algorithm can be efficiently implemented on modern graphics processing units (GPUs). Our implementation includes interactive classification and fast lighting. To accelerate the rendering we store splat geometry and 3D volume data locally in GPU memory.

This lack of detail becomes immediately apparent once one attempts to zoom into the dataset and only recovers blur. We describe a method that generates the missing detail from any available and plausible high-resolution data, using texture synthesis. Since the detail generation process is guided by the underlying image or volume data and is designed to fill in plausible detail in accordance with the coarse structure and properties of the zoomed-in neighborhood, we refer to our method as constrained texture synthesis. Regular zooms become ""semantic zooms"", where each level of detail stems from a data source attuned to that resolution. We demonstrate our approach by a medical application - the visualization of a human liver - but its principles readily apply to any scenario, as long as data at all resolutions are available.

For this task, bipolar planetary nebulae are interesting objects of study because of their pronounced axial symmetry due to fundamental physical processes. Making use of this symmetry constraint, we present a technique to automatically recover the axisymmetric structure of bipolar planetary nebulae from two-dimensional images. With GPU-based volume rendering driving a nonlinear optimization, we estimate the nebula's local emission density as a function of its radial and axial coordinates, and we recover the orientation of the nebula relative to Earth. The optimization refines the nebula model and its orientation by minimizing the differences between the rendered image and the original astronomical image. The resulting model enables realistic 3D visualizations of planetary nebulae, e.g. for educational purposes in planetarium shows. In addition, the recovered spatial distribution of the emissive gas allows validating computer simulation results of the astrophysical formation processes of planetary nebulae.

Visual data captures only a portion of the sonar data range due to the prohibitive cost and physical infeasibility of taking sufficient lighting and video equipment to such extreme depths. However, visual images are available from research dives and from the recent IMAX movie, volcanoes of the deep sea. In this application paper, we apply existing lighting models with forward scattering and light attenuation to the 3D sonar data in order to mimic the visual images available. These generated images are compared to existing visual images. This can help the geoscientists understand the relationship between these different data modalities and elucidate some of the mechanisms used to capture the data.

The geometry is updated interactively and then rendered using an unstructured volume rendering technique. Unless a detailed refinement of the flow volume is specified for the interior, information inside the underlying flow volume is lost in the linear interpolation. These disadvantages can be avoided and/or alleviated using an implicit flow model. An implicit flow is a scalar field constructed such that any point in the field is associated with a termination surface using an advection operator on the flow. We present two techniques, a slice-based three-dimensional texture mapping and an interval volume segmentation coupled with a tetrahedron projection-based renderer, to render implicit stream flows. In the first method, the implicit flow representation is loaded as a 3D texture and manipulated using a dynamic texture operation that allows the flow to be investigated interactively. In our second method, a geometric flow volume is extracted from the implicit flow using a high dimensional isocontouring or interval volume routine. This provides a very detailed flow volume or set of flow volumes that can easily change topology, while retaining accurate characteristics within the flow volume. The advantages and disadvantages of these two techniques are compared with traditional explicit flow volumes.	Xue, D.;Zhang, C.;Crawfis, R.	Dept. of Comput.

While these vector data such as electromagnetic fields, fluid flow fields, or particle paths can be represented by lines, the sheer number of the lines overwhelms the memory and computation capability of a high-end PC used for visualization. Further, very dense or intertwined lines, rendered with traditional visualization techniques, can produce unintelligible results with unclear depth relationships between the lines and no sense of global structure. Our approach is to apply a lighting model to the lines and sample them into an anisotropic voxel representation based on spherical harmonics as a preprocessing step. Then we evaluate and render these voxels for a given view using traditional volume rendering. For extremely large line based datasets, conversion to anisotropic voxels reduces the overall storage and rendering for O(n) lines to O(1) with a large constant that is still small enough to allow meaningful visualization of the entire dataset at nearly interactive rates on a single commodity PC.

In this paper we introduce the use of a reaction-diffusion model, already well known for its ability to form irregular spatio-temporal patters, to control the size, density, and placement of the vector field representation. We demonstrate that it is possible to encode vector field information (orientation and magnitude) into the parameters governing a reaction-diffusion model to form a spot pattern with the correct orientation, size, and density, creating an effective visualization. To encode direction we texture the spots using a light to dark fading texture. We also show that it is possible to use the reaction-diffusion model to visualize an additional scalar value, such as the uncertainty in the orientation of the vector field. An additional benefit of the reaction-diffusion visualization technique arises from its automatic density distribution. This benefit suggests using the technique to augment other vector visualization techniques. We demonstrate this utility by augmenting a LIC visualization with a reaction-diffusion visualization. Finally, the reaction-diffusion visualization method provides a technique that can be used for streamline and glyph placement.	Sanderson, A.;Johnson, C.R.;Kirby, R.M.	Sci.

Existing visualization methods for tensor fields only cover a fraction of the broad application areas. We present a visualization method tailored specifically to the class of tensor field exhibiting properties similar to stress and strain tensors, which are commonly encountered in geomechanics. Our technique is a global method that represents the physical meaning of these tensor fields with their central features: regions of compression or expansion. The method is based on two steps: first, we define a positive definite metric, with the same topological structure as the tensor field; second, we visualize the resulting metric. The eigenvector fields are represented using a texture-based approach resembling line integral convolution (LIC) methods. The eigenvalues of the metric are encoded in free parameters of the texture definition. Our method supports an intuitive distinction between positive and negative eigenvalues.

Our algorithm combines view-dependent simplification, occlusion culling, and out-of-core rendering. We represent the model as a clustered hierarchy of progressive meshes (CHPM). We use the cluster hierarchy for coarse-grained selective refinement and progressive meshes for fine-grained local refinement. We present an out-of-core algorithm for computation of a CHPM that includes cluster decomposition, hierarchy generation, and simplification. We make use of novel cluster dependencies in preprocess to generate crack-free, drastic simplifications at runtime. The clusters are used for occlusion culling and out-of-core rendering. We add a frame of latency to the rendering pipeline to fetch newly visible clusters from the disk and to avoid stalls. The CHPM reduces the refinement cost for view-dependent rendering by more than an order of magnitude as compared to a vertex hierarchy. We have implemented our algorithm on a desktop PC. We can render massive CAD, isosurface, and scanned models, consisting of tens or a few hundreds of millions of triangles at 10-35 frames per second with little loss in image quality.

Our technique is a generalization of cut-away views, which - depending on the viewpoint - remove or suppress less important parts of a scene to reveal more important underlying information. We automatize and apply this idea to volumetric data. Each part of the volumetric data is assigned an object importance, which encodes visibility priority. This property determines which structures should be readily discernible and which structures are less important. In those image regions, where an object occludes more important structures it is displayed more sparsely than in those areas where no occlusion occurs. Thus the objects of interest are clearly visible. For each object several representations, i.e., levels of sparseness, are specified. The display of an individual object may incorporate different levels of sparseness. The goal is to emphasize important structures and to maximize the information content in the final image. This work also discusses several possible schemes for level of sparseness specification and different ways how object importance can be composited to determine the final appearance of a particular object.

Yet traditional visibility culling algorithms were mainly designed for static data, without consideration of such potential temporal coherency. We explore the use of temporal occlusion coherence (TOC) to accelerate visibility culling for time-varying volume rendering. In our algorithm, the opacity of volume blocks is encoded by means of plenoptic opacity functions (POFs). A coherence-based block fusion technique is employed to coalesce time-coherent data blocks over a span of time steps into a single, representative block. Then POFs need only be computed for these representative blocks. To quickly determine the subvolumes that do not require updates in their visibility status for each subsequent time step, a hierarchical ""TOC tree"" data structure is constructed to store the spans of coherent time steps. To achieve maximal culling potential, while remaining conservative, we have extended our previous POP into an optimized POP (OPOP) encoding scheme for this specific scenario. To test our general TOC and OPOF approach, we have designed a parallel time-varying volume rendering algorithm accelerated by visibility culling. Results from experimental runs on a 32-processor cluster confirm both the effectiveness and scalability of our approach."	Gao, J.;Han-Wei Shen;Huang, J.;Kohl, J.A.

In this research, we evolve the dataflow concept to allow parts of the visualization process to be executed remotely in a secure and seamless manner. We see dataflow at three levels: an abstract specification of the intent of the visualization; a binding of these abstract modules to a specific software system; and then a binding of software to processing and other resources. We develop an XML application capable of describing visualization at the three levels. To complement this, we have implemented an extension to a popular visualization system, IRIS Explorer, which allows modules in a dataflow pipeline to run on a set of grid resources. For computational steering applications, we have developed a library that allows a visualization system front-end to connect to a simulation running remotely on a grid resource. We demonstrate the work in two applications: the dispersion of a pollutant under different wind conditions; and the solution of a challenging numerical problem in elastohydrodynamic lubrication.

In particular, we focus on analyzing behavior patterns in the popular team-based first-person perspective game Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory. This game belongs to a genre characterized by two moderate-sized teams (usually 6 to 12 players each) competing over a set of objectives. Our system allows spectators to visualize global features such as large-scale behaviors and team strategies, as opposed to the limited, local view that traditional spectating modes provide. We also add overlay visualizations of semantic information related to the action that might be important to a spectator in order to reduce the information overload that plagues traditional overview visualizations. These overlays can visualize information about abstract concepts such as player distribution over time and areas of intense combat activity, and also highlight important features like player paths, fire coverage, etc. This added information allows spectators to identify important game events more easily and reveals large-scale player behaviors that might otherwise be overlooked.

It is present not only in vortices but also in shear flow. Especially in ducted flows, most of the overall vorticity is usually contained in the boundary layer. When a vortex develops from the boundary layer, this can be described by transport of vorticity. For a better understanding of a flow it is therefore of interest to examine vorticity in all of its different roles. The goal of this application study was not primarily the visualization of vortices but of vorticity distribution and its role in vortex phenomena. The underlying industrial case is a design optimization for a Pelton turbine. An important industrial objective is to improve the quality of the water jets driving the runner. Jet quality is affected mostly by vortices originating in the distributor ring. For a better understanding of this interrelation, it is crucial to not only visualize these vortices but also to analyze the mechanisms of their creation. We used various techniques for the visualization of vorticity, including field lines and modified isosurfaces. For field line based visualization, we extended the image-guided streamline placement algorithm of Turk and Banks to data-guided field line placement on three-dimensional unstructured grids.

Because of the inherent intricacy of these features, standard flow visualization techniques typically yield cluttered depictions. The paper addresses the challenges raised by the visual exploration and validation of two CFD simulations involving vortex breakdown. To permit accurate and insightful visualization we propose a new approach that unfolds the geometry of the breakdown region by letting a plane travel through the structure along a curve. We track the continuous evolution of the associated projected vector field using the theoretical framework of parametric topology. To improve the understanding of the spatial relationship between the resulting curves and lines we use direct volume rendering and multidimensional transfer functions for the display of flow-derived scalar quantities. This enriches the visualization and provides an intuitive context for the extracted topological information. Our results offer clear, synthetic depictions that permit new insight into the structural properties of vortex breakdowns.

We present an integrated system that provides interactive denoising, vortex detection, and visualisation of vector data on Cartesian grids. All three major phases are implemented in such a way that the system runs completely on a modern GPU once the vector field is downloaded into graphics memory. The application aspect of our paper is twofold. First, we show how recently presented, prototypical GPU-based algorithms for filtering, numerical computation, and volume rendering can be combined into one productive system by handling all idiosyncrasies of a chosen graphics card. Second, we demonstrate that the significant speedup achieved compared to an optimized software implementation now allows interactive exploration of characteristic structures in turbulent flow fields.

Given a scattered point cloud of 3D data points and associated normal vectors, our new method produces an implicit volume model whose zero level isosurface interpolates the given points and associated normal vectors. We concentrate on certain application of these new volume modeling techniques. We take existing polygon mesh surfaces and use the present methods to construct implicit volume models for these surfaces. Implicit models allow for the application of Boolean operations on these surfaces through the techniques of constructive solid geometry. Also, standard wavelet and filter operators can be applied to the implicit volume model leading to effective smoothing and filtering algorithms, which are simple to implement.	Nielson, G.M.

Such triangulations match edges and faces across spatial cell boundaries, solving several problems in graphics and visualization including the crack problem found in adaptive isosurface generation, triangulation of arbitrary grids (including unstructured grids), clipping, and the interval tetrahedrization problem. The algorithm produces compatible triangulations on a cell-by-cell basis, using a modified Delaunay triangulation with a simple point ordering rule to resolve degenerate cases and produce unique triangulations across cell boundaries. The algorithm is naturally parallel since it requires no neighborhood cell information, only a unique, global point numbering. We show application of this algorithm to adaptive contour generation; tetrahedrization of unstructured meshes; clipping and interval volume mesh generation.

A novel texture hierarchy is introduced based on 4-8 refinements of raster tiles, in which the texture grids in effect rotate 45 degrees for each level of refinement. This hierarchy provides twice as many levels of detail as conventional quadtree-style refinement schemes such as mipmaps, and thus provides per-pixel view-dependent filtering that is twice as close to the ideal cutoff frequency for an average pixel. Because of this more gradual change in low-pass filtering, and due to the more precise emulation of the ideal cutoff frequency, we find in practice that the transitions between texture levels of detail are not perceptible. This allows rendering systems to avoid the complexity and performance costs of per-pixel blending between texture levels of detail. The 4-8 texturing scheme is integrated into a variant of the real-time optimally adapting meshes (ROAM) algorithm for view-dependent multiresolution mesh generation. Improvements to ROAM included here are: the diamond data structure as a streamlined replacement for the triangle bintree elements, the use of low-pass-filtered geometry patches in place of individual triangles, integration of 4-8 textures, and a simple out-of-core data access mechanism for texture and geometry tiles.

While much research has been done on immersive visualization, this is one of the first systems to apply advanced interface techniques to a scientific design problem. This system uses tangible 3D input devices (tongs, a raygun, and a multipurpose handle tool) to create and edit a purely digital representation of DNA. The tangible controllers are associated with functions (not data) while a virtual display is used to render the model. This interface was built in collaboration with a research group investigating the design of DNA tiles. A user study shows that scientists find the immersive interface more satisfying than a 2D interface due to the enhanced understanding gained by directly interacting with molecules in 3D space.

We approach this problem by extending 3D image-based rendering via programmable graphics units, resulting in an order of magnitude speedup over traditional triangle-based rendering. By incorporating a biochemically sensitive level-of-detail hierarchy into our molecular representation, we communicate appropriate volume occupancy and shape while dramatically reducing the visual clutter that normally inhibits higher-level spatial comprehension. Our hierarchical, image based rendering also allows dynamically computed physical properties data (e.g. electrostatics potential) to be mapped onto the molecular surface, tying molecular structure to molecular function. Finally, we present another approach to interactive molecular exploration using volumetric and structural rendering in tandem to discover molecular properties that neither rendering mode alone could reveal. These visualization techniques are realized in a high-performance, interactive molecular exploration tool we call TexMol, short for Texture Molecular viewer.

Although level-set-based methods are advantageous because they can handle complicated topologies and noisy data, most tend to smooth the inherent roughness of the original data. Our objective is to enhance the quality of a reconstructed surface by preserving certain roughness-related characteristics of the original dataset. Our formulation employs the total variation of the surface as a roughness measure. The algorithm consists of two steps: a roughness-capturing flow and a roughness-preserving flow. The roughness capturing step attempts to construct a surface for which the original roughness is captured - distance flow is well suited for roughness capturing. Surface reconstruction is enhanced by using a total variation preserving (TVP) scheme for the roughness-preserving flow. The shock filter formulation of Osher and Rudin is exploited to achieve this goal. In practice, we have found that better results arc obtained by balancing the TVP term with a smoothing term based on curvature. The algorithm is applied to both fractal surface growth simulations and scanned data sets to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.	Kim, Y.;Machiraju, R.;Thompson, D.

A set of new techniques is introduced to afford extra noise tolerability, robust orientation alignment, reliable outlier removal, and satisfactory feature recovery. In our algorithm, sample points are first organized by an octree. The points are then clustered into a set of monolithically singly-oriented groups. The inside/outside orientation of each group is determined through a robust voting algorithm. We locally fit an implicit quadric surface in each octree cell. The locally fitted implicit surfaces are then blended to produce a signed distance field using the modified Shepard's method. We develop sophisticated iterative fitting algorithms to afford improved noise tolerance both in topology recognition and geometry accuracy. Furthermore, this iterative fitting algorithm, coupled with a local model selection scheme, provides a reliable sharp feature recovery mechanism even in the presence of bad input.

Riemann surface structure is a fundamental structure and governs many natural physical phenomena, such as heat diffusion and electro-magnetic fields on the surface. A good parameterization is crucial for simulation and visualization. This paper provides an explicit method for finding optimal global conformal parameterizations of arbitrary surfaces. It relies on certain holomorphic differential forms and conformal mappings from differential geometry and Riemann surface theories. Algorithms are developed to modify topology, locate zero points, and determine cohomology types of differential forms. The implementation is based on a finite dimensional optimization method. The optimal parameterization is intrinsic to the geometry, preserves angular structure, and can play an important role in various applications including texture mapping, remeshing, morphing and simulation. The method is demonstrated by visualizing the Riemann surface structure of real surfaces represented as triangle meshes.	Miao Jin;Yalin Wang;Shing-Tung Yau;Gu, X.	Dept. of Comput.

The technique uses a lighting transfer function that takes into account the distribution of values along a material boundary and features a novel interface for visualizing and specifying these transfer functions. With our method, the user is given a means of visualizing boundaries without modifying opacity, allowing opacity to be used for illustrating the thickness of homogeneous materials through the absorption of light.

The primary focus of this paper is on finding a formulation that lends itself to a stable numerical algorithm for extracting stable and persistent topological features from 2nd order real symmetric 3D tensors. While features in 2D tensors can be identified as either wedge or trisector points, in 3D, the corresponding stable features are lines, not just points. These topological feature lines provide a compact representation of the 3D tensor field and are essential in helping scientists and engineers understand their complex nature. Existing techniques work by finding degenerate points and are not numerically stable, and worse, produce both false positive and false negative feature points. This work seeks to address this problem with a robust algorithm that can extract these features in a numerically stable, accurate, and complete manner.	Zheng, X.;Pang, A.	Dept. of Comput.

For 2D time-dependent vector fields, two such segmentations are possible: either concerning the behavior of stream lines, or of path lines. While stream line oriented topology is well established, we introduce path line oriented topology as a new visualization approach in this paper. As a contribution to stream line oriented topology we introduce new methods to detect global bifurcations like saddle connections and cyclic fold bifurcations. To get the path line oriented topology we segment the vector field into areas of attracting, repelling and saddle-like behavior of the path lines. We compare both kinds of topologies and apply them to a number of data sets.	Theisel, H.;Weinkauf, T.;Hege, H.-C.;Seidel, H.-P.

The concept of singularity index is discussed and extended from the well-understood planar case to the more intricate three-dimensional setting. Assuming a tetrahedral grid with linear interpolation in space and time, vector field singularities obey rules imposed by fundamental invariants (Poincare index), which we use as a basis for an efficient tracking algorithm. We apply the presented algorithm to CFD datasets to illustrate its purpose. We examine structures that exhibit topological variations with time and describe some of the insight gained with our method. Examples are given that show a correlation in the evolution of physical quantities that play a role in vortex breakdown.	Garth, C.;Tricoche, X.;Scheuermann, G.	Dept. of Comput.

The global view of the vector field structure is deduced by locating singularities (critical points) within the field and augmenting these points with nearby streamlines. We have used for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, three-dimensional topology to analyze the topological differences between a resonant C-shaped nano-aperture and various nonresonant conventional apertures. The topological differences between these apertures are related to the superiority in power throughput of the C-aperture versus conventional round and square sub-wavelength apertures. We demonstrate how topological visualization techniques provide significant insight into the energy enhancement mechanism of the C aperture, and also shed light on critical issues related to the interaction between multiple apertures located in close proximity to each other, which gives rise to cross-talk, for example as a function of distance. Topological techniques allow us to develop design rules for the geometry of these apertures and their desired spot sizes and brightness. The performance of various sub-wavelength apertures can also be compared quantitatively based on their topology. Since topological methods are generically applicable to tensor and vector fields, our approach can be readily extended to provide insight into the broader category of finite-difference-time-domain nano-photonics and nano-science problems.

This development is driven by advances in imaging technology, producing detectors with growing resolutions, as well as availability of cheap processing power and memory capacity in commodity-based computing clusters. We describe the design of a visualization system that allows scientists to interactively explore large remote data sets in an efficient and flexible way. The system is broadly applicable and currently used by medical scientists conducting an osteoporosis research project. Human vertebral bodies are scanned using a high resolution microCT scanner producing scans of roughly 8 GB size each. All participating research groups require access to the centrally stored data. Due to the rich internal bone structure, scientists need to interactively explore the full dataset at coarse levels, as well as visualize subvolumes of interest at the highest resolution. Our solution is based on HDF5 and GridFTP. When accessing data remotely, the HDF5 data processing pipeline is modified to support efficient retrieval of subvolumes. We reduce the overall latency and optimize throughput by executing high-level operations on the remote side. The GridFTP protocol is used to pass the HDF5 requests to a customized server. The approach takes full advantage of local graphics hardware for rendering. Interactive visualization is accomplished using a background thread to access the datasets stored in a multiresolution format. A hierarchical volume tenderer provides seamless integration of high resolution details with low resolution overviews.	Prohaska, S.;Hutanu, A.;Kahler, R.;Hege, H.-C.	Sci.

We use the method introduced by Bruckschen el al. (2001) that precomputes a large number of particles, stores them on disk using a space-filling curve ordering that minimizes seeks, then retrieves and displays the particles according to the user's command. We describe how the particle computation can be performed using a PC cluster, how the algorithm can be adapted to work with a multiblock curvilinear mesh, how scalars can be extracted and used to color the particles, and how the out-of-core visualization can be scaled to 293 billion particles while still achieving interactive performance on PC hardware. Compared to the earlier work, our data set size and total number of particles are an order of magnitude larger. We also describe a new compression technique that losslessly reduces the amount of particle storage by 41% and speeds the particle retrieval by about 20%.	Ellsworth, D.;Green, B.;Moran, P.

Part of this process is the simulation of structural and functional properties, which is in many cases based on finite element analysis (FEA). One prominent example from the automotive industry is the safety improvement resulting from crash worthiness simulations. A simulation model for this purpose usually consists of up to one million finite elements and is assembled from many parts, which are individually meshed out of their CAD representation. In order to accelerate the development cycle, simulation engineers want to be able to modify their FE models without going back to the CAD department. Furthermore, valid CAD models might even not be available in preliminary design stages. However, in contrast to CAD, there is a lack of tools that offer the possibility of modification and processing of finite element components while maintaining the properties relevant to the simulation. In this application paper we present interactive algorithms for intuitive and fast editing of FE models and appropriate visualization techniques to support engineers in understating these models. This includes new kinds of manipulators, feedback mechanisms and facilities for virtual reality and immersion at the workplace, e.g. autostereoscopic displays and haptic devices.

In this paper, we describe techniques used to visualize simulations of perturbed in-situ stress fields associated with hypothetical salt bodies in the Gulf of Mexico. We present an adaptation of the Mohr diagram, a graphical paper and pencil method used by the material mechanics community for estimating coordinate transformations for stress tensors, as a new tensor glyph for dynamically exploring tensor variables within three-dimensional finite element models.

Combining DTI data with the computational methods of MR tractography, neuroscientists can estimate the locations and sizes of nerve bundles (white matter pathways) that course through the human brain. Neuroscientists have used visualization techniques to better understand tractography data, but they often struggle with the abundance and complexity of the pathways. We describe a novel set of interaction techniques that make it easier to explore and interpret such pathways. Specifically, our application allows neuroscientists to place and interactively manipulate box-shaped regions (or volumes of interest) to selectively display pathways that pass through specific anatomical areas. A simple and flexible query language allows for arbitrary combinations of these queries using Boolean logic operators. Queries can be further restricted by numerical path properties such as length, mean fractional anisotropy, and mean curvature. By precomputing the pathways and their statistical properties, we obtain the speed necessary for interactive question-and-answer sessions with brain researchers. We survey some questions that researchers have been asking about tractography data and show how our system can be used to answer these questions efficiently.

We take advantage of partially segmented data with approximately identified vessel centerlines to comprehensively visualize the diseased peripheral arterial tree. We introduce the VesselGlyph as an abstract notation for novel focus & context visualization techniques of tubular structures such as contrast-medium enhanced arteries in CT-angiography (CTA). The proposed techniques combine direct volume rendering (DVR) and curved planar reformation (CPR) within a single image. The VesselGlyph consists of several regions where different rendering methods are used. The region type, the used visualization method and the region parameters depend on the distance from the vessel centerline and on viewing parameters as well. By selecting proper rendering techniques for different regions, vessels are depicted in a naturally looking and undistorted anatomic context. This may facilitate the diagnosis and treatment planning of patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease. In this paper we furthermore present a way of how to implement the proposed techniques in software and by means of modern 3D graphics accelerators.

The objective of this research is to estimate the dimensions of lower extremity arteries, imaged by computed tomography (CT). These parameters are required to get a good quality visualization of healthy as well as diseased arteries using a visualization technique such as curved planar reformation (CPR). The vessel is modeled using an elliptical or cylindrical structure with specific dimensions, orientation and blood vessel mean density. The model separates two homogeneous regions: its inner side represents a region of density for vessels, and its outer side a region for background. Taking into account the point spread function (PSF) of a CT scanner, a function is modeled with a Gaussian kernel, in order to smooth the vessel boundary in the model. A new strategy for vessel parameter estimation is presented. It stems from vessel model and model parameter optimization by a nonlinear optimization procedure, i.e., the Levenberg-Marquardt technique. The method provides center location, diameter and orientation of the vessel as well as blood and background mean density values. The method is tested on synthetic data and real patient data with encouraging results.	La Cruz, A.;Straka, M.;Kochl, A.;Sramek, M.;Groller, E.;Fleischmann, D.

Direct visualization techniques are often used to display wave fronts. However, the information derived from such visualizations may not be as central to an investigation as an understanding of how the location, structure and time course of the wave change as key experimental parameters are varied. In experimental data, these questions are confounded by noise and incomplete data. Recognition of waves in networks of neurons is additionally complicated by the presence of long-range physical connections and recurrent excitation. This work applies visual techniques to analyze the structural details of waves in response data from the turtle visual cortex. We emphasize low-cost visualizations that allow comparisons across neural data sets and variables to reconstruct the choreography for a complex response.	Robbins, K.A.;Robinson, M.;Senseman, D.M.

In addition to shading nonlinear data, last and accurate rendering of planar cuts through parametric elements can be implemented using programmable shaders on current graphics hardware. The intersection of a planar cut with geometrically curved volume elements can be rendered using a combination of selective refinement and programmable shaders. This hybrid algorithm also handles curved 2D planar triangles.	Brasher, M.;Haimes, R.	Aerosp. Computational Design Lab., MIT, MA, USA|c|;	37282899400;37282898700

Our method is composed of three stages: in the first stage, the Gauss points of the FEA cells are calculated. The function values, gradients, diffusions, and influence scopes of the Gauss points are computed. By representing the Gauss points as graph vertices and connecting adjacent Gauss points with edges, an adjacency graph is created. The adjacency graph is used to represent the FEA data in the subsequent computation. In the second stage, a hierarchical structure is established upon the adjacency graph. Any two neighboring vertices with similar function values are merged into a new vertex. The similarity is measured by using a user-defined threshold. Consequently, a new adjacency graph is constructed. Then the threshold is increased, and the graph reduction is triggered again to generate another adjacency graph. By repeating the processing, multiple adjacency graphs are computed, and a level of detail (LoD) representation of the FEA data is established. In the third stage, the LoD structure is rendered by using a splatting method. At first, a level of adjacency graph is selected by users. The graph vertices arc sorted based on their visibility orders and projected onto the image plane in back-to-front order. Billboards are used to render the vertices in the projection. The function values, gradients, and influence scopes of the vertices are utilized to decide the colors, opacities, orientations, and shapes of the billboards. The billboards are then modulated with texture maps to generate the footprints of the vertices. Finally, these footprints are composited to produce the volume rendering image.

Most frequently, time-varying simulations are performed over multiple spatial grids at discrete points in time. We investigate a new approach to time-varying simulation: spacetime discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods. The result of this simulation method is a simplicial tessellation of spacetime with per-element polynomial solutions for physical quantities such as strain, stress, and velocity. To provide accurate visualizations of the resulting solutions, we have developed a method for per-pixel evaluation of solution data on the GPU. We demonstrate the importance of per-pixel rendering versus simple linear interpolation for producing high quality visualizations. We also show that our system can accommodate reasonably large datasets - spacetime meshes containing up to 20 million tetrahedra are not uncommon in this domain.	Zhou, Y.;Garland, M.;Haber, R.

These massive 3D meshes are used in mission-critical CFD and structural mechanics simulations, and typically sample multiple field values on several millions of unstructured grid points. Our method relies on the preprocessing of the tetrahedral mesh to partition it into nonconvex boundaries and internal fragments that are subsequently encoded into compressed multiresolution data representations. These compact hierarchical data structures are then adaptively rendered and probed in real-time on a commodity PC. Our point-based rendering algorithm, which is inspired by QSplat, employs a simple but highly efficient splatting technique that guarantees interactive frame-rates regardless of the size of the input mesh and the available rendering hardware. It furthermore allows for real-time probing of the volumetric data-set through constructive solid geometry operations as well as interactive editing of color transfer functions for an arbitrary number of field values. Thus, the presented visualization technique allows end-users for the first time to interactively render and explore very large unstructured tetrahedral meshes on relatively inexpensive hardware.

The point-based approach is built on an extraction scheme that classifies different sections of the isosurface into four categories, depending on the size of the geometry when projected onto the screen. In particular, we use points to represent small and subpixel triangles, as well as larger sections of the isosurface whose projection has subpixel size. To assign consistent and robust normals to individual points representing such regions, we propose to compute them during post processing of the extracted isosurface and provide the corresponding hardware implementation.

Although the techniques proposed are general, we focus on silicon (Si) atomic systems. The first set of methods use 3D location of atoms. Defects are detected and categorized using local operators and statistical modeling. Our second set of exploratory techniques employ electron density data. This data is visualized to glean the defects. We describe techniques to automatically detect the salient isovalues for isosurface extraction and designing transfer functions. We compare and contrast the results obtained from both sources of data. Essentially, we find that the methods of defect (feature) detection are at least as robust as those based on the exploration of electron density for Si systems.

Hidden within this massive and complex data are answers to basic questions about how cells function. The data afford an opportunity to take a global or systems approach studying whole proteomes comprising all the proteins in an organism. However, the tremendous size and complexity of the high-throughput data make it difficult to process and interpret. Existing tools for studying a few proteins at a time are not suitable for global analysis. Visualization provides powerful analysis capabilities for enormous, complex data at multiple resolutions. We developed a novel interactive visualization tool, PQuad, for the visual analysis of proteins and peptides identified from high-throughput data on biological samples. PQuad depicts the peptides in the context of their source protein and DNA, thereby integrating proteomic and genomic information. A wrapped line metaphor is applied across key resolutions of the data, from a compressed view of an entire chromosome to the actual nucleotide sequence. PQuad provides a difference visualization for comparing peptides from samples prepared under different experimental conditions. We describe the requirements for such a visual analysis tool, the design decisions, and the novel aspects of PQuad.	Havre, S.L.;Singhal, M.;Payne, D.A.;Webb-Robertson, B.-J.M.	Pacific Northwest Nat.

Our algorithm overcomes several challenges residing in current surface meshing methods. First, we guarantee the mesh quality with a provable lower bound of 21° on its minimum angle. Second, we ensure the triangulation is homeomorphic to the original surface. Third, we improve the efficiency of constructing the restricted Delaunay triangulation (RDT) of smooth surfaces. We achieve this by constructing the RDT using the advancing front method without computing the Delaunay tetrahedrization of the sample points on the surfaces. The difficulty of handling the front collision problem is tackled by employing the Morse theory. In particular, we construct the Morse-Smale complex to simplify the topological changes of the front. Our implementation results suggest that the algorithm decrease the time of generating high quality homeomorphic skin mesh from hours to a few minutes.	Cheng, H.-L.;Shi, X.	Sch. of Comput., Nat.

These new isosurfaces have the same separating properties as the MC surfaces but they are comprised of quad patches that tend to eliminate the common negative aspect of poorly shaped triangles of the MC isosurfaces. Based upon the concept of this new dual operator, we describe a simple, but rather effective iterative scheme for producing smooth separating surfaces for binary, enumerated volumes which are often produced by segmentation algorithms. Both the dual surface algorithm and the iterative smoothing scheme are easily implemented.	Nielson, G.M.	Arizona Univ., Tucson, AZ, USA|c|	37283754100

Many real-world data sets produce unmanageably large contour trees which require meaningful simplification. We define local geometric measures for individual contours, such as surface area and contained volume, and provide an algorithm to compute these measures in a contour tree. We then use these geometric measures to simplify the contour trees, suppressing minor topological features of the data. We combine this with a flexible isosurface interface to allow users to explore individual contours of a dataset interactively.	Carr, H.;Snoeyink, J.;van de Panne, Michiel	Dept. of Comput.

The underlying concept behind our approach is to preserve the disconnected surface components in cells during isosurface simplification. We represent isosurface components in a novel representation, called enhanced cell, where each surface component in a cell is represented by a vertex and its connectivity information. A topology-preserving vertex clustering algorithm is applied to build a vertex octree. An enhanced dual contouring algorithm is applied to extract error-bounded multiresolution isosurfaces from the vertex octree while preserving the finest resolution isosurface topology. Cells containing multiple vertices are properly handled during contouring. Our approach demonstrates better results than existing octree-based simplification techniques.

To reduce the risk associated with this treatment, the surgeon must be skilled and well-prepared. Virtual endoscopy can be beneficial as a tool for training, preoperative planning and intraoperative support. This work introduces STEPS, a virtual endoscopy system designed to aid surgeons in getting acquainted with the endoscopic view, the handling of instruments, the transsphenoidal approach and challenges associated with the procedure. STEPS also assists experienced surgeons in planning a real endoscopic intervention by getting familiar with the individual patient anatomy, identifying landmarks, planning the approach and deciding upon the ideal target position of the actual surgical activity. Besides interactive visualization using two different first-hit ray casting techniques, the application provides navigation and perception aids and the possibility to simulate the procedure, including haptic feedback and simulation of surgical instruments.

Given the MRI volume data of articular cartilage, medical doctors investigate pathological changes of the thickness. Since the tissue is very thin, it is impossible to reliably map the thickness information by direct volume rendering. Our idea is based on unfolding of such structures preserving their thickness. This allows to perform anisotropic geometrical operations (e.g., scaling the thickness). However, flattening of a curved structure implies a distortion of its surface. The distortion problem is alleviated through a focus-and-context minimization approach. Distortion is smallest close to a focal point which can be interactively selected by the user.

Our scientific goal was to determine where a protein is located, and how much its concentration varies along the membrane of a neuronal dendrite. The 3D scalar field data sets fall into two categories: dendritic plasma membranes (defining the structure) and immunofluorescent staining (defining protein concentration along the structure). ImageSurfer enables scientists to analyze relationships between multiple data sets obtained with confocal microscopy by providing 3D surface view, height field, and graphing tools. Each tool reduces the complexity of the problem by extracting a restricted subset of data: finding a region of interest in 3D; getting a sense of relative concentrations in 2D, and getting exact concentration values in 1D. The current design is presented, along with the rationale for each design decision. The tool is already proving useful for data exploration, analysis, and presentation.

However, constructing effective multiperspective images is something of an art. We describe an interactive system for creating multiperspective images composed of serially blended cross-slits images. Beginning with a sideways-looking video of the scene as might be captured from a moving vehicle, we allow the user to interactively specify a set of cross-slits cameras, possibly with gaps between them. In each camera, one of the slits is defined to be the camera path, which is typically horizontal, and the user is left to choose the second slit, which is typically vertical. The system then generates intermediate views between these cameras using a novel interpolation scheme, thereby producing a multiperspective image with no seams. The user can also choose the picture surface in space onto which viewing rays are projected, thereby establishing a parameterization for the image. We show how the choice of this surface can be used to create interesting visual effects. We demonstrate our system by constructing multiperspective images that summarize city blocks, including corners, blocks with deep plazas and other challenging urban situations.

The motion is estimated through an eigenvector analysis of the spatio-temporal structure tensor at every pixel location. This approach is computationally demanding but allows reliable velocity estimates as well as quality indicators for the obtained results. We use a 2D color map and a region of interest selector for the visualization of the velocities. On the selected velocities we apply a hierarchical smoothing scheme which allows the choice of the desired scale of the motion field. We demonstrate several examples of test sequences in which some persons are moving with different velocities than others. These persons are visually marked in the real-time display of the image sequence. The tool is also applied to angiography sequences to emphasize the blood flow and its distribution. An efficient processing of the data streams is achieved by mapping the operations onto the stream architecture of standard graphics cards. The card receives the images and performs both the motion estimation and visualization, taking advantage of the parallelism in the graphics processor and the superior memory bandwidth. The integration of data processing and visualization also saves on unnecessary data transfers and thus allows the real-time analysis of 320×240 images. We expect that on the newest generation of graphics hardware our tool could run in real time for the standard VGA format.	Strzodka, R.;Garbe, C.	Caesar Res.

In particular, we simulate airborne contaminant propagation in open environments characterised by sky-scrapers and deep urban canyons. Our approach is based on the multiple relaxation time lattice Boltzmann model (MRTLBM), which can efficiently handle complex boundary conditions such as buildings. In addition, we model thermal effects on the flow field using the hybrid thermal MRTLBM. Our approach can also accommodate readings from various sensors distributed in the environment and adapt the simulation accordingly. We accelerate the computation and efficiently render many buildings with small textures on the GPU. We render streamlines and the contaminant smoke with self-shadowing composited with the textured buildings.

This growth has given rise to advances in scientific and engineering simulations that have put a high demand on tools for high-performance large-scale data exploration and analysis. These simulations have the potential to generate large amounts of data. Humans, however are relatively poor at gaining insight from raw numerical data, and as a result, have used visualization as a tool for understanding, interpreting and exploring data of all types and sizes. Allowing for efficient visual explorations of data, however, requires that the ratio of knowledge gained versus the cost of the visualization be maximized. This, in turn, mandates the integration of principles from human perception. Understanding perception as it relates to visualization requires that we understand not only the biology of the human visual system, but principles from vision theory, and perceptual psychology as well. This panel is the result of bringing together practioners and researchers from a broad spectrum of interests relating to the ability to maximize the amount of information that is effectively perceived from a given visualization.

Visualization helps developers to better comprehend these large and complex systems. This work presents a three-dimensional visualization technique that represents the static structure of object-oriented software using distributions of three-dimensional objects on a two-dimensional plane. The visual complexity is reduced by adjusting the transparency of object surfaces to the distance of the viewpoint. An approach called Hierarchical Net is proposed for a clear representation of the relationships between the subsystems.	Balzer, M.;Deussen, O.	University of Konstanz|c|;	37282568100;37266781000

However in visualization systems, this link between features in the data and the meaning of those features is often missing or implicit. It is assumed that the user, through looking at the output, will close the loop between representation and insight. An alternative is to view visualization tools as interfaces between data and insight, and to enrich this interface with capabilities linked to users conceptual models of the data. Preliminary work has been carried out to develop such an interface as a modular component that can be installed in a pipelined architecture. This poster expands the motivation for this work, and describes the initial implementation carried out within the Visualization Toolkit (VTK).	Duke, D.J.	University of Leeds|c|

Motivation for this includes defining web and grid services for visualization (the semantic grid), supporting collaborative work, curation, and underpinning visualization research and education. At a preliminary meeting, members of the UK visualization community identified a skeleton for the ontology. We have started to build on this by identifying how existing work might be related and utilized. We believe that the greatest challenge is reaching a consensus within the visualization community itself. This poster is intended as one step in this process, setting out the perceived needs for the ontology, and sketching initial directions. It is hoped that this will lead to debate, feedback and involvement across the community.	Duke, D.J.;Brodlie, K.W.;Duce, D.A.	University of Leeds|c|;;	37282576200;37271754900;37266247700

The task for interactively visualizing such a massive terrain is to render a triangulated mesh using a view-dependent error tolerance, thus intelligently and perceptually managing the scene??s geometric complexity. At any particular instance in time (i.e. displayed frame), this level-of-detail (LOD) terrain surface consists of a mesh composed of hundreds of thousands of dynamically selected triangles. The triangles are selected using the current time-step??s view parameters and the view-dependent error tolerance. Massive terrain data easily exceeds main memory storage capacity such that out-of-core rendering must be performed. This further complicates the triangle selection and terrain rendering owing to tertiary storage??s relatively poor performance.	Xiaohong Bao;Pajarola, R.;Shafae, M.

The underlying approach is to maximize the use of current graphics hardware by using 3D texture mapping. This approach commonly suffers from an expensive voxelization of each time-step as well as from large size of the voxel array approximating each step. Hence, in our scheme, instead of explicitly voxelizing each scalar field, we directly store each time-step as a three dimensional texture in its native form. We create the function that warps a voxel grid into the given structured grid. At rendering time, we reconstruct the function at each pixel using hardware-based trilinear interpolation. The resulting coordinates allow us to compute the scalar value at this pixel using a second texture lookup. For fixed grids, the function remains constant across time-steps and only the scalar field table needs to be re-loaded as a texture. Our new approach achieves excellent performance with relatively low texture memory requirements and low approximation error.

We propose a method for denoising 2-D vector fields that are corrupted by additive noise. The method is based on the vector wavelet transform and wavelet coefficient thresholding. We compare our wavelet-based denoising method with Gaussian filtering, and test the effect of these methods on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the vector fields before and after denoising. We also study the effect on relevant details for visualization, such as vortex measures. The results show that for low SNR, Gaussian filtering with large kernels has a somewhat higher performance than the wavelet-based method in terms of SNR. For larger SNR, the wavelet-based method outperforms Gaussian filtering. This is mostly due to the fact that Gaussian filtering tends to remove small details, which are preserved by the wavelet-based method.	Westenberg, M.A.;Ertl, T.

Although it is well known that CHD mainly occurs due to blocked arteries, there are contradictory results from studies designed to identify basic causes for this common disease is. To find out more about the true reason for CHD, virtual models can be employed to better understand the way the heart functions. With such a model, scientists and surgeons are able to analyze the effects of different treatment options, and ultimately find more suited ways to prevent coronary heart diseases. To investigate a given model, appropriate navigation methods are required, including suitable input devices. For the visualization, graphics cards originally designed for gaming applications are used; so, it is a just natural transition to adapt gaming input devices to a visualization system for controlling of the navigation. These devices are usually well designed with respect to ergonomics and durability, yielding more degrees of freedom in steering than two-dimensional input devices, such as desktop mice. This poster describes a visualization system that provides the user with advanced control devices for navigation enabling interactive exploration of the model. Force-feedback and sound effects provide additional cues.	Wischgoll, T.;Moritz, E.;Meyer, J.	University of California at Irvine|c|;;	37282584400;37267820900;37279771900

The first three channels are stored in the volume textures red, green, and blue components. The fourth channel is stored in the alpha channel. To achieve real-time rendering speed we are using a pixel shader.	Schulze, J.P.;Rice, A.	Brown University|c|;	38470435200;37282594800
