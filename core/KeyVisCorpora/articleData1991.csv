In particular, maximum value projection, sum of values projection, transparent gray level gradient shading, and surface shading have been tested. Due to the fact that ultrasound data suffer from a low signal to noise ratio, image processing and image analysis are used to enhance and classify the volumetric data set	Thune, N.;Olstad, B.

By viewing these components separately, it is difficult for MR practitioners to conceptualize and comprehend the underlying flow structures, especially when the image data have strong background noise. A flow visualization technique that adapts the idea of particle tracing used in classical fluid dynamics for visualizing flow is presented. The flow image processing relies on the strong correlation between the principal flow direction estimated from the distribution of the modulus of the velocity field and the direction derived from the raw image data. By correlation calculation, severe background noise can be eliminated. Flow pattern rendering and animation provide an efficient way for representing internal flow structures	Yang, G.Z.;Kilner, P.J.;Mohiaddin, R.H.

The tools include shadows, mirrors, specularity, and constructive solid geometry. The underlying representation for the ray tracer is a 3-D raster of voxels that holds the discrete form of the scene. Unlike traditional volume rendering techniques, the discrete recursive ray tracer models many illumination phenomena by traversing discrete rays in voxel space. The approach provides true ray tracing of sampled or computed datasets, as well as ray tracing of hybrid scenes where sampled or computed data are intermixed with geometric models and enhances the understanding of complex biomedical datasets	Yagel, R.;Kaufman, A.;Zhang, Q.

The geometry of image production, stereography, and shadows in 4D is analyzed. Alternatives for smooth and specular shaded rendering of curves, surfaces, and solids in 4D are examined and a new approach that systematically converts curves or surfaces into uniquely renderable solids in 4D space by attaching spheres or circles to each point is proposed. Analogs of 3D shading methods are used to produce volume renderings that distinguish objects whose 3D projections from 4D are identical. Analyzing the procedures needed to justify and evaluate a system as this for teaching humans to `see' in four dimensions leads to the proposal of a generally applicable four-step visualization paradigm	Hanson, A.J.;Heng, P.A.

In exploratory data visualization, it is typically not known what is being looked for: instead, the data are explored with a variety of visualization techniques that can illuminate its nature by demonstrating patterns in it. With this approach, the authors were able to find new features in some of their oldest datasets and to create more vivid presentations of familiar features in these datasets. Their experience has also led to a better understanding of the nature of the exploratory visualization and has resulted in some formal representations of the interaction process in this environment	Smith, S.;Grinstein, G.;Bergeron, R.D.

The program displays a 3D shape containing the sequence similarities and differences, which manifest themselves as simple geometric shapes and colors that a human observer can easily detect and classify. The method presents all possible correlations to the user, giving it a considerable advantage over existing sequence comparison tools that only search for a programmed subset of all possible correlations. Thus, using this technique, researchers may detect sequence similarities that other analytic methods might completely overlook. The program can also filter out undesirable or insignificant correlations. The technique is easily adapted to a wide range of applications	Hinckley, K.P.;Ward, M.O.	Dept. of Comput.

The SDSC Image Tool suite provides a simple, extensible, and portable mechanism for the support of a variety of common image formats so that tool-writers can concentrate on the task in hand, rather than on the quirks of a particular image file format. Users of such tools are able to work with images generated from a variety of sources, without being restricted to an arbitrary standard format.

With little or no instrumentation of the application the user will be able to dynamically select data for graphical display as the program executes on a remote computer system. The data to be displayed and the type of display to be used are chosen interactively while the application is executing. Any data display can be enabled and disabled at any time; it is not necessary to specify the data or graphics technique before compilation as with conventional graphics tools. An architecture for such a remote visualization system is proposed, and an implementation, called Vista, is described.

Previous results are extended to the case of piecewise field representations (associated with grid-based data representations), and a general mathematical model for piecewise representations of fields on irregular grids is presented. The various types of regularity that can be found in computational grids and techniques for compact field representation based on each form of regularity are discussed.

The two systems use parallel and pipelined architectures for high-performance graphics operations. UWGPSP3 uses only commercially available off-the-shelf chips, and consists of a TM34020 graphics system processor and four TMS34082 floating point coprocessors that can be configured into pipelined or SIMD modes depending on the algorithm. UWGSP4 uses dedicated ASIC chips for higher performance, and consists of two main computational parts: a parallel vector processor with 16 vector processing units, used mainly for image processing, and a graphics subsystem which utilizes a parallel pipelined architecture for image synthesis	Park, H.W.;Eo, K.S.;Kim, D.L.;Choi, B.K.;Alexander, T.

The configuration of 24 spheres touching a central sphere in this packing is shown to be rigid, unlike the analog in 3-space, in which the spheres can slide past each other. A system for interactively manipulating and visualizing such configurations is described. The Voronoi cell for a sphere is the set of points closer to its center than to any other sphere center in the packing. The packing density is the ratio of a sphere's volume to the average of the volumes of the Voronoi cells. A method of constructing Voronoi cells and computing their volumes that works in any dimension is presented. Examples of Voronoi cell volumes are given	Max, N.

An inexpensive, straightforward method is discussed for reducing the number of elements searched for such isovalues. It takes advantage of one traversal of the element data to yield a compact classification of the model by result values and ranges, with no sorting required. This data structure can then relate any scalar isovalue to a set of element groups which are closely inclusive of the isovalue. This method is intended for applications requiring repeated access to the analysis data, such as animation and interactive rendering of isosurfaces and scalar fields. While applicable to general volume visualization problems, it is particularly well suited to optimizing real-valued continuum field results such as those found in finite-element data	Gallagher, R.S.

In particular, for silicon computations it is found that volumetric visualization of the computed 3D electronic charge density is a valuable tool for identifying defect states in silicon lattices in which oxygen atoms occur as impurities. Rendering of several judiciously selected ranges of charge density in translucent colors provides an effective means of identifying broken or altered molecular bonds and induced charge excesses in the lattice. The resulting 3D images reveal important features missed previously in 2D charge density contour maps. Stereoscopic `blink comparison' of image pairs is an extremely valuable way to study the structural differences among various configurations, and animation provides significant insight into the molecular dynamics	Wolfe, R.H.;Needels, M.;Joannopoulos, John D.

Historically, scientific visualization has been carried out in two primary modes: interactive on desktop computers, and batch on high-performance computers. The next decade will see a merging of these two approaches with the advent of high-speed networking. The networking is hierarchical in speed from Ethernet to FDDI to HiPPI. This network effectively unites desktop computers with higher-value remote resources into a single metacomputer.

An earlier technique (shear decomposition) is extended to 3D, and it is shown how this can be mapped onto a data-parallel architecture using only grid communication during the resampling associated with the rotation. The rendering uses efficient parallel computation constructs that allow one to use sophisticated shading models and still maintain high-speed throughout.

The tree-map visualization technique makes 100% use of the available display space, mapping the full hierarchy onto a rectangular region in a space-filling manner. This efficient use of space allows very large hierarchies to be displayed in their entirety and facilitates the presentation of semantic information. Tree-maps can depict both the structure and content of the hierarchy. However, the approach is best suited to hierarchies in which the content of the leaf nodes and the structure of the hierarchy are of primary importance, and the content information associated with internal nodes is largely derived from their children	Johnson, B.;Shneiderman, B.

The volume can be broken up in a structured or unstructured manner, and the problem can be static or unsteady in time. Because the data are volumetric and all the information can be changing, traditional CAD techniques are not appropriate. Therefore, VISUAL3 was developed using intermediate mode-rendering methods.

An important point is the direct feedback of information from the visualization into an ongoing simulation. Some strong and weak points of the varying approaches in different software packages are shown. The visualization component of the authors' program system and the advantages of its integration into the overall system are explained. The weak points in their system and the work remaining to deal with them are described	Lang, U.	Stuttgart Univ. Comput. Center, Germany|c|	38227139100

Hundreds of data points can easily be represented in one diagram, using small gray-scale squares (or tiles), without visually overloading a viewer. An experiment was done to compare the subjects' responses to questions from three types of charts, traditional column and line charts and gray-scale tile charts. The results showed that questions were answered more correctly and more quickly using gray-scale tile charts than using traditional charts. However, subjects reported they experienced more strain using gray-scale charts	Feeney, W.R.	Dept. of Inf. & Decisions Syst., San Diego State Univ., San Diego, CA, USA|c|	38221881400

Focusing techniques may involve selecting subsets, dimension reduction, or some more general manipulation of the layout information on the page or screen. A consequent of focusing is that each view only conveys partial information about the data and needs to be linked so that the information contained in individual views can be integrated into a coherent image of the data as a whole. Examples are given of how graphical data analysis methods based on focusing and linking are used in applications including linguistics, geographic information systems, time series analysis, and the analysis of multi-channel images arising in radiology and remote sensing	Buja, Andreas;McDonald, J.A.;Michalak, J.;Stuetzle, W.

These speeds have made the combination of region selection with volume rendering practical for the first time. Semantic-driven selection, rather than geometric clipping, has proved to be a natural means of interacting with 3D data. Internal organs in medical data or other regions of interest can be built from preprocessed region primitives. The resulting combined system has been applied to real 3D medical data with encouraging results	Yoo, T.S.;Neumann, U.;Fuchs, H.;Pizer, S.M.;Cullip, T.;Rhoades, J.;Whitaker, R.

A means of rapidly rendering a slice of a 3D field, suitable for a bilevel display, is provided. Shape and shadowing are used to disambiguate orientation.
